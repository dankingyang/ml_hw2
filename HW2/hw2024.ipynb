        "Next, we will be fitting a decision tree classifier and prune the tree appropriately. The `DecisionTreeClassifier` in scikit-learn uses a way of pruning called **Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning**. We won't cover the specifics, but you can learn more from this [link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#minimal-cost-complexity-pruning) if you wish. But, you don't need to learn the details in order to use it effectively. The amount of pruning is entirely dependent on the value of the `ccp_alpha` parameter. In order to tune the `ccp_alpha` parameter, you will use [cross-validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html). The purpose of cross-validation is to estimate how well a model will generalize on unseen data.\n",

Your function should vary the value of the `ccp_alpha` parameter and return the value for `ccp_alpha` with the highest cross-validation F1 score over the given dataset `train_df`. The sklearn library has a [built-in function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.cost_complexity_pruning_path) to generate a list of effective ccp_alphas. Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, most of the people in the data set are non-diabetic. You can get a model with very high test accuracy by always predicting no one is diabetic. To address this problem, more importance should be given to the [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) of your model rather than the classification accuracy.\n",
